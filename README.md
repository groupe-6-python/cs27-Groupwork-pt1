Description:
our project prompts the user to enter various personal and academic details (name, birth year, school, ID, etc.) using input() calls.
It calculates the student's age and key dates related to the card (delivery year, expiration, end of studies) based on the entered values.
The program then displays a formatted summary of the student card, including all entered fields and calculated values.
A boolean variable valide = True is used to indicate that the card is currently valid, and this status is shown at the end of the summary.
